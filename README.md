##### Wrangells 1 - https://cdn.rawgit.com/cosgrovc/GEOG4572-PE2/7a3daf9c/map1.html

I designed *Wrangells 1* to be a simple map for showing location of my field work in the Wrangell St Elias National Park. I built it up from scratch using the Satellite template and added just the features that I feel are relevant to a remote location; communications, either rivers or roads, places of interest, mountain peaks, admin boundaries and labels. The symbology, colouration and font were chosen to be unobtrusive yet distinct for the features that they depict - for the place labels I created a maki icon by following this link  https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/editor/

This basemap was an exercise in colour paletting really - I used https://www.canva.com/color-palette/ and uploaded the image below to get a palette inspired by a very atmospheric day in the mountains. I wanted something elegant and clean, and this notion followed into my selection of Merriweather fonts.

The above photo produced a palette of #CCCEE2 #B4ABC2 #3E3C45 #828493 #A5A7B8

The colours from the palette I tried to apply carefully and appropriately to different features of the Mapbox Streets template. I was really inspired by the understated yet effective New York Times mapping and hence went for a muted scheme
